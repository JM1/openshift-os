# RULE: If repos support all architectures then put them in the global repos list
# at the top of this file (directly below this comment). If we don't we can have
# consistency issues across arches. See e.g. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-52293.

  # Some of the extensions here have version bindings to host packages. Add the
  # mirrors since those retain multiple versions of packages in case the latest
  # compose has already moved since the last base image build.
